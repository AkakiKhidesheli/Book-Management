The main goal was to create a bilingual website for managing li. Full website is written by me (but at the moment of creating this website, I didn't know front-end very well so AI helped me with some front-end parts), mostly using Django Core, Bootstrap, Crispy Forms and other front-end elements. Book images are copied from other websites for demonstrational purposes only. Wallpapers and logos (including logo used for the thumbnail) are designed by Freepik.
